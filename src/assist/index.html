      <h2>Original Research question</h2>
      <p>Our research began with emphasis on a specific group of people and a specific scenario.</p>
      <p class="mt-4"><b>How might we help someone with low or no vision navigate an unfamiliar building accurately and
          confidently?</b></p>

        <h2>Research methods</h2>
        <h4>Interviews</h4>
        <small>We went to Seattle Lighthouse for the Blind and talked to people about their workplace and how they
          navigate new places. We also interviewed several people with vision impairments to understand how they
          navigate daily life.</small>
        <h4>Observation</h4>
        <small>We observed people as they navigated public spaces like train stations and libraries.</small>
        <h4>Survey</h4>
        <small>We conducted a survey of people with vision disabilities to understand current strategies and main pain
          points for navigation.</small>
        <h4>Literature review</h4>
        <small>We read research about wayfinding and perception to understand what was already out there.</small>

<!-- Pivot -->

        <h2>Pivot</h2>
        <p>After all of our sketching, we were still unsure which direction we should go in. We returned to our
          research
          findings for further analysis. Using affinity diagramming, we looked at our research through different
          lenses. We noticed that the people we talked to didn't really express strong pain points around navigation at
          all. The problem seemed to be more that they felt like a burden for asking others for help. This helped us
          completely reframe our thinking.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="emphasized">The problem that we were trying to solve was less about helping people navigate spaces
          than it was about getting people help when they need it most.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With this insight, we shifted focus to an application that would help people get the help they needed when
          they
          need it through a micro-volunteering platform: Assist.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Mapping</h2>
        <p>I did an exercise to map the interaction flow of the system. Because Assist is a multi-sided platform, it
          was important to lay out the interaction of both the helper
          and
          the requestor side by side to see how both experiences work together across the system.</p>
