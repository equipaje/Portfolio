        <h2>Pivot</h2>
        <p>After all of our sketching, we were still unsure which direction we should go in. We returned to our research
          findings for further analysis. Using affinity diagramming, we looked at our research through different lenses. This helped us reach a pivotal realization.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="emphasized">The problem that we were trying to solve was less about helping people navigate spaces
          than it was about getting people help when they need it most.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With this insight, we shifted focus to an application that would help people get the help they needed when they
          need it through a micro-volunteering platform: Assist.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Mapping</h2>
        <p>Because Assist is a multi-sided platform, it was important to lay out the interaction of both the helper and the requestor side by side to see how both experiences work together across the system.</p>

        volunteer experience, we used InVision to create an interactive prototype.</p>

      <p>Because we wanted to be able to effectively test with our target user group, people with disabilities, we kept
        a physical paper prototype of the help request experience.</p>
