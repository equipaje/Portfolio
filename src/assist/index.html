        <h4>Interviews</h4>
        <small>We went to Seattle Lighthouse for the Blind and talked to people about their workplace and how they
          navigate new places. We also interviewed several people with vision impairments.</small>
        <h4>Observation</h4>
        <small>We watched people navigate public spaces like train stations and libraries.</small>
        <h4>Survey</h4>
        <small>We conducted a survey of people with vision disabilities.</small>
        <h4>Literature review</h4>
        <small>We read research about wayfinding and perception.</small>

        <h2>Pivot</h2>
        <p>After all of our sketching, we were still unsure which direction we should go in. We returned to our
          research
          findings for further analysis. Using affinity diagramming, we looked at our research through different
          lenses. This helped us reach a pivotal realization.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="emphasized">The problem that we were trying to solve was less about helping people navigate spaces
          than it was about getting people help when they need it most.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With this insight, we shifted focus to an application that would help people get the help they needed when
          they
          need it through a micro-volunteering platform: Assist.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Mapping</h2>
        <p>Because Assist is a multi-sided platform, it was important to lay out the interaction of both the helper
          and
          the requestor side by side to see how both experiences work together across the system.</p>

        kept
        a physical paper prototype of the help request experience.</p>
