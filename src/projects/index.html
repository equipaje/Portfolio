                <h5>Automatic Alt Text</h5>
                <small>Automatic Alt Text is a service that makes documents more accessible for people with cognitive
                    and vision disabilities by using computer vision to add alt text to photos in Microsoft
                    Office documents. I dreamt up this project as part of an alt text experience redesign, and drove it
                    from just an idea idea through research, design, and implementation. I collaborated across
                    Microsoft and across the accessibility community, and I had the opportunity to work with many
                    talented engineers to make this project a reality. Today, Automatic Alt Text creates alt text for
                    more than 2 million images every day, improving equal access of documents for everyone.</small>

                <small>Communicating via text can be challenging, especially for people with cognitive disabilities. EQ
                    Assistant aims reduce miscommunication problems by enriching text communication with more emotional
                    cues generated via sentiment analysis and machine learning. I worked with a small team at the
                    University of Washington to research, ideate, and design the EQ Assistant solution. I was
                    responsible for conducting interviews, creating prototypes, visual design, and analyzing

                    on ways to help people with vision impairments navigate new spaces. Assist represents a solution
                    that meets both the needs of people with vision impairments as well as those of people with many
                    other
