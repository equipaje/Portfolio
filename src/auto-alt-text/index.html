            <p>Alternative text, commonly referred to as alt text, is critical to helping people with vision
                impairments and cognitive disabilities
                understand graphical content. While emphasis on accessibility is increasing across the tech industry,
                there is still too much digital content that is inaccessible.</p>
            <br>
            <p> For more than a decade, Microsoft Office employed an alt text authoring experience that was difficult
                to find and use for people trying to make accessible content. Moreover, it resulted in a poor reading
                experience for people who rely on screen readers to consume content in an increasingly digital world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In an effort to make the digital world more accessible, I set out to improve and reimagine the alt text
                creation and consumption experience in Office.

            <p>While ideating solutions to make alt text easier to access, understand, and create, I came across the
                newly released Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Cognitive Services are able to
                generate natural language descriptions of images using Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I thought
                this could be a great opportunity to add machine intelligence to alt text while improving the overall
                experience for both authors and consumers of alt text.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I pitched the idea, and worked with several engineers to prototype a proof of concept during a
                hackathon. The project ultimately was funded by our team.</p>

                    <small class="mt-2"><b>Problem:</b> In user studies, I found that many people do not know what
                        alt text is. We needed a prompt that conveyed purpose and helped people understand how to write
                        good alt text.</small>
                    <br>
                    <small><b>Solution:</b> I interviewed accessibility experts and people with vision impairments
                        to inform our chosen prompt. I worked with partners to land on something very clear with little
                        room for
                        misinterpretation.
                        We also added a length suggestion, since people we talked to identified overly long alt text
                        as a core pain point.</small>

                        difficult for someone who is blind to understand whether or not they should trust a caption.</small>
                    <br>
                    <small><b>Solution:</b> Once a description was generated, we appended text that marked the
                        description as being machine generated.
                        We also included a confidence rating so that screen reader users could make better decisions
                        about trusting the alt text.</small>

                    <h4>Gathering Feedback</h4>
                    <small class="mt-2"><b>Problem:</b> A key component of intelligent systems is collecting
                        feedback so that the system can improve over time. There are many privacy regulations that

                    <br>
                    <small><b>Solution:</b> The Computer Vision model we were using had been trained almost
                        exclusively on social media content. In other words, it was extremely bad at recognizing
                        the professional content that someone would insert into an Office document. We thought this
                        might block the entire project from continuing.</small>
