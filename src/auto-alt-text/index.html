            <p>Alternative text, commonly referred to as alt text, is critical to helping people with vision
                impairments and cognitive disabilities
                understand graphical content. While emphasis on accessibility is increasing across the tech industry,
                there is still too much digital content that is inaccessible.</p>
            <br>
            <p> For more than a decade, Microsoft Office employed an alt text authoring experience that was difficult
                to find and use for people trying to make accessible content. Moreover, it resulted in a poor reading
                experience for people who rely on screen readers to consume content in an increasingly digital world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In an effort to make the digital world more accessible, I set out to improve and reimagine the alt text

            <p>While ideating solutions to make alt text easier to access, understand, and create, I came across the
                newly released Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Cognitive Services are able to
                generate natural language descriptions of images using Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I thought
                this could be a great opportunity to add machine intelligence to alt text while improving the overall
                experience for both authors and consumers of alt text.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I pitched the idea, and worked with several engineers to prototype a proof of concept during a
                hackathon. The project ultimately was funded by our team.</p>

                        alt text is.
                        We
                        needed a
                        prompt that conveyed purpose and helped people understand how to write good alt text.</small>

                        misinterpretation. We
                        also added a length suggestion, since people we talked to identified overly long alt text
                        as a
