            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Have you ever mistaken a short text response from a friend as anger or indifference? We lose so much
                information about emotion through text messaging. For many people, however, text-based messaging is a
                preferred and primary way of communicating with others. Modern text communication needs to evolve to
                fill in these gaps that can lead to misunderstanding and potentially result in stress and problems with
                relationships.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <h4>Predictions should be actionable</h4>
            <small>Participants expressed interest in the idea that emotions could help alert them to more
                urgent messages.</small>
            <h4>Emotion analysis needs to be visible to everyone</h4>
            <small>Participants did not like the idea that their message could be incorrectly interpreted
                without their knowledge. They wanted the opportunity to verify or change the analysis.</small>
            <h4>Consider unique relationships</h4>
            <small>Every participant we talked with mentioned the importance of unique relationships. Communication
                happens differently depending on the relationship between the people talking. Our design needs to
                provide more flexibility to allow for unique relationships.</small>
            <h4>Feedback needs to be part of the core UX</h4>
            <small>Our participants told us that they were not interested in going out of their way to provide feedback
                to improve the model. Feedback needs to be built into the way that people interact with the app.</small>
